## Mxl to Jianpu

***Still in development***

This python project's goal is to generate a word document in the **jianpu** music notation from a **mxl** music file.

It will only do the basics, but you can add more and decorate the created word document.

The word file will use the [**simperhu**](https://simperhu.weebly.com) word "extension"

Goals:
- [ ] Generate doc file
- [ ] add some interface to it (maybe a webpage where you can control the situation)
