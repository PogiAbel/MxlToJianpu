## Mxl to Jianpu

This python project's goal is to generate a Jianpu word document from a mxl music file.

It will only do the basics, but you can always add mor to the created word doc.

The doc file will use the [**simperhu**](https://simperhu.weebly.com) word "extension"

Or maybe generate the pdf file...

Goals:
- [ ] Generate doc file
- [ ] generate pdf
- [ ] add some interface to it (maybe a webpage where you can control the situation)
